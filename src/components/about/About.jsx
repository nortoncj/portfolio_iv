                  Iâ€™m a digital strategist who transforms data into engaging
                  experiences. With expertise in web development, email
                  automation, content strategy, and data analysis, I create
                  strategic impactful online solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My interests in data science started in my content creation
                  journey. I use track trends and other KPI&apos;s to improve my
                  content as well as finding new ways to build a personal brand
                  like email.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I&apos;m not coding, I&apos;m spending time with my
                  family. I also enjoy outdoor activities like my outdoor
                  fitness training, flying drones and karaeoke.
